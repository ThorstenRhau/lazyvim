# Thorsten's lazyvim config
Shortly after I finished my Packer based configuration of neovim I realised  that I wanted to switch to the lazy.nvim packet manager. So here is another repo with very similar configuration.

This repo is intended for my personal use, it is public for easier cloning.

## Dependencies

<pre>
brew install git ripgrep wget fd node
</pre>

## Cloning

<pre>
git clone https://github.com/ThorstenRhau/lazyvim.git ~/.config/nvim
</pre>
